                <p>Dandelion Wine is a work that stands out among the literary work of Ray Bradbury for the personal experiences of the writer. This is largely an autobiographical book. The main character, a boy named Douglas Spaulding, is an allusion to Bradbury himself: Douglas is his middle name, and Spaulding is the maiden name of his paternal grandmother.

                </p>
                <p>In 1971, the crew of the Apollo 15 spacecraft named one of the craters of the Moon Dandelion in honor of the story "Wine from Dandelions" (the name has not yet been approved by the International Astronomical Union).</p>
                <p>The action takes place in the summer of 1928 in the fictional town of Greentown, Illinois, based on Bradbury's hometown of Waukegan. The plot revolves around the Spaulding brothers: Douglas (12 years old) and Tom (10 years old). The tale consists of a string of stories that happened in a small town for three summer months with brothers, their relatives, neighbors, friends, acquaintances.</p>

            <p>Tom and Douglas' grandfather makes dandelion wine every summer. Often Douglas thinks that this wine should keep the current time, the events that happened when the wine was made: “Wine made from dandelions. These words themselves are like summer on the tongue. Dandelion Wine - Caught and Bottled Summer "</p>
            <p>Initially, the story was conceived more complex and voluminous, but the editor Walter Bradbury (namesake) suggested to the writer: “Take this book by the ears and pull in different directions. It will break in two. Every second [story] will be dropped, and the rest will take their place. They will form your first book, and the rest will be your sequel. " However, a sequel titled "Summer, Goodbye!" came out only in 2006, and the stories that were not included were published a year later by the collection "Summer morning, summer night".</p>

O Alquimista) is a novel by Paulo Coelho, published in 1988 and became a world bestseller.</p>
                <p> in more than 117 countries around the world, translated into 81 languages, including High Valyrian. The novel is listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the best-selling book in Brazilian history and the most translated in the world.</p>
                
                <p> main plot is taken from European folklore: according to the classification of folklore plots by Aarne-Thompson-Uther - plot 1645 "Treasure of the House". A typical representative is the English fairy tale "The Pedlar of Swaffham" ("The dream of a peddler"), as well as one of the episodes of "A Thousand and One Nights". More than 145 thousand books have been published.</p>
            
            <p>The author began his research in the field of alchemy in the mid-seventies. But not seeing the results of his zeal and zeal, in 1973 he stopped research. In 1981, the author met a teacher who divided alchemists into three types: some love uncertainty, because they do not know their subject; others know him and understand that "the language of alchemy is directed to the heart, and not to the mind"; still others do not know about alchemy, "they managed to open the Philosopher's Stone with their whole life." The story will go about the alchemist of the second type.</p>
            <p>The main character of the book is the shepherd Santiago from Andalusia. One day he has a dream that calls him to see the Egyptian pyramids and find the treasure hidden in them.</p>
            <p>A certain gypsy woman agrees to solve his dream in exchange for one tenth of the treasures he finds in the future. He meets the old man Melchizedek - the king of Salem, who convinces him to go to Egypt and gives two stones, Urim and Thummim, which should help Santiago overcome the trials, in exchange for one-tenth of his cattle.

                The hero sells his sheep, sails to Africa, loses all his money. He works as an assistant to a crystal merchant and, with the money earned, still goes to the pyramids. On a trip, he meets an Englishman, who reveals to him knowledge in Alchemy, and then finds the Alchemist in the oasis of El-Fayyum.
                
                The Alchemist teaches him to cognize the "Soul of the World", talks about Alchemy and helps him to follow the path of His Destiny. He falls in love with Fatima and eventually finds treasures, but not in Egypt, but in his homeland - in Spain, having passed all the trials that fate has in store for him.</p>
